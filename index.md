# kibibit's Document Explorer - Jekyll theme

Basically, there are **3 page layouts** at the moment:

- #### homepage
  have navigation on the side

- #### default
  clean page with a `bulma.io` markdown theme.
  currently, there's only a "Back" button to take you to the homepage

- #### postmortem
  meant to be used to write postmortem posts.
  TODO: need to document variables needed for the page
