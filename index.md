# kibibit's Document Explorer - Jekyll theme

Basically, there are **3 page layouts** at the moment:

- #### homepage
  have navigation

- #### default
  clean page with a `bulma.io` markdown theme. have navigation

- #### postmortem
  meant to be used to write postmortem posts.
    currently, there's only a "Back" button to take you to the homepage
  TODO: need to document variables needed for the page

## Available Includes

By default, the theme supports the following includes:

- #### backy
  use `include backy.html` in order to include a back button to the homepage (or use like `include backy.html upbyone=true` in order to go up one step)

- #### explain
  use `include explain.html details="<explanation>"` to add an index after a specific word. the `details` variable will be included in the footer

- #### navigation
  use `include nav.html` to add the navigation bar to your page

- #### date
  use `include date.html day="2015-10-21"` to include a date tag.
  date tags support the following variables: `day`, `zone`, `location` (`include date.html day="2015-10-21" zone="UTC" location="Tel-Aviv, Israel"`)

## Automatic header anchor links
The theme uses `anchor.js` to add anchor links to `h2`, `h3`, `h4` and `h5` headers.
`h1` headers are considered main headers (one per page) so they don't have automatic anchor links

## Dark theme button
Uses bulmawatch. later, will allow you to select the theme with a jekyll variable
